# Geno-Diver Shiny App

Below is a Shiny App to quickly plot trends across generation for multiple files. The app is designed to quickly determine if the current simulation parameters are what is desired and to troubleshoot any issues that arise without having to write code to plot the data across the different output files. At the current time the following output files can be utilized to generate trends across time:

* Summary_Statistics_DataFrame_Performance
* Summary_Statistics_DataFrame_Inbreeding
* Summary_Statistics_QTL
* LD_Decay
